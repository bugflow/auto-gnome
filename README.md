# auto-gnome

GitHub Ticket Gnome.

This project was a bit of a brain-fart that existed before GitHub Actions. I'm not aware of anyone using it for anything anymore.

Lesson learned from this project:
* The basic design idea of keeping magic config files in your code repo, that control the behavior of automated processes, seems like a good one.
* it's pretty easy to make good stuff by hooking an AWS Lambda callback to GitHub event API
