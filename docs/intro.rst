Introduction
============

Bugflow is a perspective on software development that focusses on the speed and efficiency with which bugs are created (as well as features, enhancements, and other more subjective descriptions of software changes)

The Bugflow auto-gnome is a mechanism for reducing the bugflow resistance by automating tedious tasks, freeing up developers to focus on creating new bugs.

It is inspired by the concept of a WikiGnome. The source code is available, in all it's buggy glory at https://github.com/bugflow/auto-gnome/
