Operating Gnomes
================

These are not garden variety gnomes, they live in the computers.

For now, got to Miserlou's Zappa web site and see all about zappa. That's how we are doing it now, but there's not much zappa-specific stuff (it's a simple web api, that mashes up other apis, written in python and making use of flask)

copy zappa_settings.json.example -> zappa_settings.json

Edit it to your liking. Make sure you have an AWS account set up (you can use the cli, right?)
